### Compatibility
DotExtensions supports:
* .NET Standard 2.0 (Limited Support)
* .NET 8
* .NET 9

However, it is important to note that not all features may be supported by all TFMs. 

**Note for DateOnly**: Though DateOnly was originally part of .NET 6, this library's DateOnly extension methods are only supported for .NET 8 and .NET 9 users since we don't target .NET 6 as a TFM due to being out of support.

## Roadmap
DotExtensions aims to make working with different types in the System namespace in C# easier.

All stable releases must be stable and should not contain regressions.

Future updates should aim to focus on one or more of the following:
* Adding extension methods that improve ease of use
* Enhancing existing extension methods

**Note**: This library is not a primitive library and also does not seek to add new interfaces or implementations of interfaces. It is purely a library for extension methods.
