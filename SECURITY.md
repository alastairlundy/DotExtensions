### Security Vulnerabilities
If you wish to report a potential security vulnerability please go to the security tab on this GitHub project and create a new Security Vulnerability report. 

Please ensure information about the potential vulnerability is contained in the report!

I will attempt to provide acknowledgement of receipt of the reported security vulnerability shortly after being notified of it. 

It may take a few days to investigate the issue and subsequently decide how to handle the potential vulnerability if is accepted as one.

Whilst a vulnerability is being investigated, please do not publish any details about the vulnerability with others.
